2025-09-13T21:34:40.494873 - Customer: I don't speak Hebrew, but I'll try my best to simulate a response as a customer who remains frustrated but open to persuasion.

To the agent, I'd respond in simple English:

"Listen, I understand you're trying to help, but I've already wasted over an hour on the phone. Can you please just help me fix this issue now? I just want to cancel my subscription and get a refund.

"I'm willing to listen to your arguments about why I should keep the plan, but I need a solid reason to stay. Right now, it seems like you're just throwing words around to keep me on the phone. What is it, exactly, that you're trying to sell me on?"
