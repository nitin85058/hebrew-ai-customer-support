Hello Eliav, good morning.

Regarding your satellite dish, there's no specific time limit for maintenance on Shabbat. 
However, in our weekly schedule on Shabbat morning, we've allocated time to perform maintenance on all the TV channels so that they're back up and running. 
I'll look into restarting the TV channel for you, even if it's past the scheduled maintenance time, so it's fixed for you.

2025-09-13 21:15:45,665 - INFO - Generated summary: Here's a concise summary of the customer service conversation:

A customer, David, calls to report issues with his TV subscription, mentioning that he's been a loyal customer with Kochav for a long time but has been experiencing problems with channel availability and poor customer service. The agent apologizes, checks his account, and discovers that the premium package has been selected, which should include all the channels he paid for. 

However, the agent offers David a discount and a free upgrade after the customer expresses frustration and announces plans to cancel his subscription. David rejects the offer, stating that it's too little, too late and wants a guarantee that the problem will be fixed.

Translation: I understand you want to cancel, okay. I'll check into the technical issue. Three hours a day with the TV freezing on the internet is unacceptable?

To the agent, I'd respond in simple English:

"Listen, I understand you're trying to help, but I've already wasted over an hour on the phone. Can you please just help me fix this issue now? I just want to cancel my subscription and get a refund.

"I'm willing to listen to your arguments about why I should keep the plan, but I need a solid reason to stay. Right now, it seems like you're just throwing words around to keep me on the phone. What is it, exactly, that you're trying to sell me on?"

A customer cancels their subscription with Haifa Haifa TV due to poor service, specifically issues with freezing and lag on internet streaming. The customer service representative initially tries to offer assistance and ask for more information, but when the customer insists on canceling, they try to persuade them to stay with the service by offering a technical solution. The customer remains open to listening, but their frustration grows as they feel the agent is not offering a concrete solution. The customer then switches to English, reiterating their willingness to cancel and seeking a solid reason to stay.
